my algorithm is so simple and these are the steps :

1/convert the .PLY file to .txt file to facilate the extraction of the data.

2/extract the data from txt .file to a 2D array (lignes :2109,columns : 4).

3/convert the 2D array to a vector of points, each point has(X,Y,Z,reflectivity)//

4/now we do loop on each point in the originale file(uncompressed), 

and we calculate the cartesian distance between the point i from the originale file with all the points in the compressed file,

and store each distance in a vector of distances.

we take the vector of distances and we find the smallest distance,

and take it's index in the vector of distances,

then we put the point that belong to that index in the compressed file, in a new vector of points,

the we get the closest point from the compressed file to the point from the originale file.
